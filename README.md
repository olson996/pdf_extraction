# flask nlp application
This repository contains a flask web application that can be ran from a local host. The web application supports uploading pdfs which the application then performs NLP. Users can login and save their work to view later. The database used is SQLite, and migration has been set up for deployment. 

You can run this application by cloning this repository to your local host and activating the virtual environment included.
```
$ localvenv\scripts\activate
$ set FLASK_APP=application.py
$ flask run
```

You may need to download [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) first.
(See [python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for more information on activating virtual environments.)
